FULL CREDIT

NOTE: These are measurements which may vary plus your opinions which may vary a LOT. We won't grade for "correctness", just completeness.

QUESTION 1: What Boggle command line arguments ([#boards] and if not default [boardSize])did you use to achieve a 30 to 45 second runtime? Note: We're only interested in the "real" seconds for this question.

200




QUESTION 2: Provide the full output (including the time command) for your program, with 1 to 16 threads. **Ensure that the result is the same for all 16 runs.** With bash, you can run all of these with a single command if you like, replacing "90" with whatever Boggle command line arguments you identified in QUESTION 1: 

for i in {1..16} ; do echo ; echo $i Threads; time java Boggle 90 - $i ; done

$ time java Boggle 200

QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?

    Adding a second thread cut the time in half.
    I think this is because two things are doing the work that one was doing before, so its kind of
    similar to real life if you work together, something can be done in half the time(most of the time).


QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?

Yes, from 0.285 seconds to 1.667 seconds for this data set

QUESTION 5: Time your version of Boggle as you did for the full credit version. Is this additional layer of threading faster, slower, or roughly equivalent in performance? Why?
